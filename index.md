I am a senior student majoring in **Statistics** and minoring in **Artificial Intelligence** at Harbin Institute of Technology(HIT). Currently, I am a member of the Research Center for Social Computing and Information Retrieval **(SCIR)**, where I will be pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science starting in 2024. I am privileged to be under the guidance of [Prof. Xiao Ding](http://ir.hit.edu.cn/~xding/). 

## Academic Background

- **Sep 2020 - June 2024 (Expected):**  Harbin Institute of Technology (BSc)
- **Sep 2020 - June 2024 (Expected):** Harbin Institute of Technology (BEng)

## Research Interests

- Brain-Computer Interface, BCI
- Natural Language Processing. NLP
- Neuroscience

My current investigations delve into the intricate interactions between the human brain and computational technologies. I am particularly drawn to Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) and its potential to revolutionize our interaction with machines. Concurrently, I am passionate about Natural Language Processing (NLP), as I believe in the transformative power of seamless communication between humans and computers. Underlying these interests is a deep appreciation for Neuroscience, which provides the foundational understanding of our cognitive processes. In essence, groundbreaking fields like BCI, NLP, and Neuroscience are poised to redefine our future. I am committed to contributing to these areas and driving positive change for humanity.
